        <h1>FOR SVA LOML</h1>
        <p>

            Okay, so today is officially my last day in this school and like I’ve mentioned earlier, I’ll not be meeting you today, because I just cannot bring myself to look into those eyes of yours (btw they look exquisitely beautiful even without under eye concealer) and say goodbye. Now that I didn’t get the seat in the college I wanted, I won’t be going to Mumbai anymore.</p>
            <p>You’ve told me a couple million times that it’s not the end we’ll be meeting in cafes idhar udhar but it just reminds me how Srija ma’am promised me that we’ll meet regularly and we did but unfortunately only thrice and I haven’t seen her face in the past 6 months…I kinda lost her and the bond…plus you have an even busier schedule nd I don’t think that you like it if I text you when you’re already so busy plus I’d never want to disturb you; and because I love you more than i can show and even more than I know, I’m just so afraid of losing you, because you’re not just a mentor to me, you’re my sister, my strength, oh my lovely lovely Veronica ma’am. </p>
            <P>It feels like it was just a week ago when I first met you and look, now I won’t even get to see you for months or maybe years :) I just hope you don’t forget me….you won’t right?</P>
            <P>I’d like to apologise for all the times you were hurt because of me, I’m extremely sorry for that and I’m sorry that I was not a very good student, I could not live up to your expectations but let me tell you that even if I was not an excellent student I promise you I’ll be a great human being and a very successful one, I hope you’ll be proud of me then, as a part of the credits goes to you as well for making me believe in myself and love myself again.</P>
            <P>I can never forget your “my friend has Anal tumour and this place smells like it” or “the city of Kelela..oh no country…oh no it’s a city only dude!! What is it?” “Oh wait, did I just say Kelela?!” Or “stick your boobies out” or your absurd questions like “what colour’s your panty?” Or you craving food almost everyday in the bus, or your curled up pinky finger when you try to make a point or you getting terrified by the sound of thunder or your randomly moving fingers when you sleep in the bus with your mouth open or your faltu AirPods wala prank or your sarcasm or the beautiful heart of yours or we can just say that I can never forget YOU. </P>
            <P>So this is my goodbye gift for you and I hope you like it because I made it from my heart, with nothing but love, wishing you all the best in your life I hope your dream of going Abroad and drinking from their libraries, learning and teaching, comes true someday (don’t worry I’m not into black magic you wrote this in my diary and you tore it asw :(( idk some ppl are moody in general) Stay the way you are because you are one of the most beautiful person inside out, that I’ve ever come across. Whoever told you that you don’t look as good as Madhuri Dixit, I’m sorry but they’ve never known you from the inside or maybe they’re just blinded by jealousy :)</P>
            <P>You don’t even realise it but you’ve done so much for me, it might be negligible for you but I can never forget those little things…from pulling me back when you saw me struggling to get down from the staircase, to feeding me with your own hands, to believing in me when I say I see things, to protecting me from the crowd in the auditorium, to singing homesick for me when I was sad, to even wiping your wet hands on my face for that matter, you have always been by my side and I thank god every single day for blessing me with your love and care, cuz people usually don’t do all this for me, but you did and I’m so so so grateful for that.</P>
           <p>I hope you know that “I love you further than Eris” and trust me I try my 100% to do whatever you ask me to but today for once I want something from you…. Which is…even if you see me today by any chance (I'm pretty sure you won’t but still) please ignore me, cuz my heart is ektu shattered from the fact that I won’t see you anytime soon.</P>
            <P>Just know it doesn’t matter whether I’m a part of this school or not I’ll always always be there to wipe every single tear that falls from your eyes not because you’ve wiped mine but because I love you unconditionally and when you feel that no one’s hearing you out or the world’s against you..I hope you know that this girlie boss queen pop can go against the world for you plus I’m one call/text or few kms away;)</P>
            
            <P>Hoping to make you proud someday and to see you soon…I’ll miss you…a lot.</P>
            
           <p>Goodbye,
            Aradhana.
